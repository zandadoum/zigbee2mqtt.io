Each zone sends commands to a ZigBee group which is currently hardcoded. Zone 1 is mapped to ZigBee group 101, Zone 2 to 102 and so forth. This means that currently each remote controls the same ZigBee groups. To control lights or smartplugs, first create a ZigBee group with the correct ID (10X), name it like you wish then add the devices you intend to control to that group (pay attention to use the right termination point).</p><p>Very important : do NOT add the remote itself to the group.</p><p>ON and OFF Master Button on top of the remote will command an extra zone with Group ID 108. You can for instance use it as a master switch or just as an add on zone.</p><p>Obviously you can only have 1 FUT089Z remote per Zigbee network as it always command groups with 101 to 108 ID</p><p>There is no support for sending events instead of commands. Which means that there is no other automation you can build out of the group assignement described above.</p><p>Beauty is that after you pair remote and define up to 8 zones, the command will work even with Zigbee2MQTT down, ... even better without any alive Zigbee controller. It looks like a perfect emergency backup.</p><h3 id="quirks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quirks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Quirks</h3><p>Like most of battery powered devices, the remote does not respond to any ZigBee commands sent after initial configuration without taking out the battery and putting it back in. To send any command to it (like a Leave or configure command), take out the battery, send the command and quickly put it back in.</p><p>It does also not support binding its light output clusters or manually joining it to a group.</p><h3 id="touchlink" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#touchlink" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Touchlink</h3><p>The remote supports Touchlink.
